VoxGamer ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how your personal information is collected, used, and disclosed by VoxGamer. This Privacy Policy applies to our application named VoxGamer.

By accessing or using our Service, you signify that you have read, understood, and agree to our collection, storage, use, and disclosure of your personal information as described in this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Service.

## 1. Information We Collect

### A. Information You Provide to Us
**Account Information:** In order to use certain features (such as "Favorites" synchronization, voting, or commenting), you may register using your Google Account. We collect your name, email address, and profile picture provided by the Google Sign-In service (Firebase Authentication) to create and manage your user profile.

### B. Information Collected Automatically
**Usage Data:** We may collect statistics about your interactions with the app, such as the games you view, crash reports, and performance data to improve the stability of the application. This is done through third-party services like Google Analytics for Firebase.

**Device Information:** We may collect specific information about your mobile device, including the hardware model, operating system version, unique device identifiers, and mobile network information.

**App Data & Synchronization:** VoxGamer uses a background service (`flutter_background_service`) to synchronize the game database locally on your device. This process downloads public game data but does not upload your personal files or sensitive information from your device.

## 2. How We Use Your Information

We use the information we collect to:
* **Provide and maintain the Service:** To synchronize game data, display images, and manage your local database.
* **Personalize your experience:** To save your "Favorites" list and game ratings across devices (using Cloud Firestore).
* **Improve the app:** To analyze crash reports and fix bugs using Firebase Crashlytics.
* **Communication:** To respond to your comments or questions if you contact us support.

## 3. Third-Party Services and Data Sources

We utilize third-party services that may collect information used to identify you. Below are the links to the privacy policies of the third-party service providers used by the app:

* **Google Play Services:** [Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy)
* **Firebase (Analytics, Crashlytics, Authentication, Firestore):** [Privacy Policy](https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy)

**Data Source Disclaimer:**
VoxGamer displays game information (metadata, images, release dates) obtained from public sources and open-source projects, specifically [SteamDataScraper](https://github.com/andymartin1991/SteamDataScraper).

## 4. App Permissions

VoxGamer requires certain permissions to function correctly:
* **Internet Access:** Required to download game databases, images, and sync user data.
* **Foreground Service / Wake Lock:** Required to perform the initial database synchronization without interruption, ensuring a "Offline-First" experience.
* **Notifications:** Required to inform you when a background synchronization is complete.

## 5. Security

We value your trust in providing us your Personal Information, thus we are striving to use commercially acceptable means of protecting it. All data transmission between the app and our servers (Firebase) is encrypted via SSL/TLS. However, remember that no method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable, and we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
